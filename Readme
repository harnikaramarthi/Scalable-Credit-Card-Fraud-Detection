Credit Card Fraud Detection — README
Overview

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. The dataset contains anonymized transaction details, and the goal is to classify each transaction as fraud or legitimate. Due to heavy class imbalance, the project focuses on proper preprocessing, sampling techniques, and evaluation metrics beyond accuracy.

Dataset

Source: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection

Rows: ~284,807 transactions

Features: V1–V28 (PCA components), Amount, Time

Target: Class (0 = normal, 1 = fraud)

Key Steps
1. Data Preprocessing

Remove duplicates

Scale numerical features (Amount, Time)

Train-test split using Stratified sampling

Handle imbalance: SMOTE, undersampling, or class-weight adjustments

2. Modeling

Models tried:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost / LightGBM
Best model chosen based on F1-score and Recall for the fraud class.

3. Evaluation

Important metrics:

Precision, Recall, F1

ROC AUC

Precision–Recall AUC

Confusion Matrix

Results (Sample Expected Outcome)

Recall (Fraud): 0.90+

F1-Score (Fraud): 0.85+

ROC AUC: 0.98+
